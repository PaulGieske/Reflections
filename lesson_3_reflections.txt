When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are working with multiple people on a project and if you are working from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Other people might also be making changes to the file.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: an alternative development trackt to take the project
Clones: copy a project, branches and all
Branches: an alternative development track within one project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The latest version of the remote is known.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without any version-control tool one would have to manually keep track of changes and versions. Merging would be more difficult.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you are working on an experimental feature. If multiple people are changing the code simultaneously, you could each work on your own branch, and merge the changes later.
